# My CS Degree

My 2021 goal of learning as much of the CS fundamentals as possible. Not having a formal CS degree but having >5 years experience wanted to test my knowledge, fill in any gaps, and learn something new along the way.

## Algorithms

- Linear time:
  - Maximum number of guesses == number of elements in the list
  - O(n)
- Log (logarimthic time)
  - Binary search for example. Splitting the search space in half every iteration.
  - An array of size 128 has max 7 iterations. Double the size of the array, increase the max iterations by 1 
    - Assuming log(n). log2(128) == 7, log2(256) == 8.
